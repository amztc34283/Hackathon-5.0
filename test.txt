I am hungry, but I think you are not.
Would you like to buy me some snack?
When I was fourteen, I immigrated to the United States with my family. When I first saw this country, I fell in love with it. Sadly, I only stayed in this beautiful country for a year because my family decided to move back to Hong Kong. I began feeling resentment toward my family because I didn’t understand why we moved back. A year later, my mother informed me that my father was bankrupt and we no longer had a reliable income stream. Since then, my life had been turned upside down. For one, I could no longer afford expensive clothes, but more importantly, we were no longer a happy family.

Despite my resentment, I realized I had to step up for my family financially. To alleviate the economic burden on my family, I worked daily after school as a waiter. I also started living frugally. At the beginning, I cried my eyes out at night and felt depressed because I couldn’t adapt to these new changes. Each day I wanted to give up, but as I continued to persist, I gradually became mentally stronger.

With so much responsibility to take on, I learned to adapt to different challenging environments with both a positive mindset and a strong set of habits. During school time, I managed to finish all my homework, so I could concentrate on my job after school. At work, I avoided thinking negatively when I encountered a bad customer.

My adaptability, positive mindset, and determination had helped me to overcome half a year worth of struggles. This experience even helped me thrive later in life. I excelled more in classes, became more disciplined, and developed a positive mind-set that has given me the confidence to know I can over-come any obstacle. More importantly, I am now able to fully appreciate the second chance I was given to study at the United States after losing a chance once, and I intend to make the most out of it by seizing my future opportunities.
